Edited by Nemesis on 1/11/2007. Increased the maximum path length, and added
support for filenames and paths which contain spaces. Spaces are also supported
with the /j option, however include paths specified with /j must now always be
terminated by an asterisk. Eg, use asm68k /j "c:\include\*".

USAGE : asm68k /options source,object,symbol,listing,temporary file

Options :
	/c		enable listing of conditioned out lines

	/j path		specify include file search path
	/k		allow use of ifeq, etc.
	/l		produce linkable output file
	/m		expand macros in listing file
	/o opts		set assembler options/optimisations
	/p		produce pure binary output file
	/ps		produce binary file in s-record format
	/q		run quietly
	/w		write equates to symbol/linker file
	/x		treat undefined symbols as XREFs
